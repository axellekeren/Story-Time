            <h2>Little Red Riding Hood</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near a forest. She always wore a red riding hood, so everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother asked her to bring some cakes and a pot of butter to her grandmother who lived on the other side of the forest.</p>
                <p>On her way through the forest, Little Red Riding Hood met a wolf who asked her where she was going. She innocently told him about her visit to her grandmother. The cunning wolf took a shortcut to the grandmother's house and arrived there first.</p>
                <p>When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, the wolf pretended to be her grandmother and lured her closer. But Little Red Riding Hood noticed something strange about her "grandmother," and the wolf eventually revealed himself. Just then, a hunter passing by heard their cries and rushed in. He chased the wolf away and saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.</p>
                <p>From that day on, Little Red Riding Hood never strayed from the path through the forest and always listened to her mother's advice.</p>
