            <h2>The Brave Little Tailor</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a little tailor who was known for his cleverness and skill. One day, while he was sewing in his shop, he felt hungry and decided to eat some jam. As he was about to take a bite, a swarm of flies landed on his bread. Annoyed, the tailor grabbed a piece of cloth and swatted at the flies, killing seven of them with a single blow.</p>
                <p>Proud of his feat, the tailor made himself a belt with the words “Seven in one blow” stitched on it. He decided to set out into the world to seek his fortune, wearing his new belt as a sign of his bravery. As he walked along the road, he came across a giant who was amazed by the tailor's belt. The giant, thinking the tailor had killed seven men, challenged him to prove his strength.</p>
                <p>The clever tailor accepted the challenge and used his wits to outsmart the giant. He squeezed water out of a cheese to make it look like he could squeeze stones, threw a bird into the air to make it seem like he could throw heavy objects, and tricked the giant into carrying a tree that he pretended to help with. Impressed and intimidated, the giant invited the tailor to stay with him and his brothers.</p>
                <p>During his stay, the tailor continued to use his cleverness to handle the giants. One night, he pretended to sleep in the giant's bed but actually hid behind it. When the giants tried to kill him, they struck the bed instead, thinking they had crushed him. The tailor escaped and told the giants he had survived their attack unharmed, further frightening them.</p>
                <p>The tailor continued his journey and eventually arrived at a kingdom where he heard about a princess who was troubled by two giants. The king promised his daughter’s hand in marriage to anyone who could defeat the giants. The brave little tailor accepted the challenge, and with his clever tricks, he managed to outsmart and scare the giants away.</p>
                <p>The king, though reluctant to have a tailor as his son-in-law, kept his promise, and the tailor married the princess. However, the king soon regretted his decision and plotted to get rid of the tailor. But the clever tailor overheard the plan and outwitted the king’s men, securing his place in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>And so, the brave little tailor lived happily ever after as a clever and cunning king, admired by all for his wit and bravery.</p>
