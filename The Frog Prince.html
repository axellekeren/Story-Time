            <h2>The Frog Prince</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who lived in a splendid palace. She had everything she could ever want, but her favorite possession was a golden ball that she loved to play with by the palace pond.</p>
                <p>One day, as she was tossing and catching the ball, it slipped from her hands and fell into the deep water. The princess began to cry as she watched her beloved ball sink. Suddenly, she heard a voice saying, "Why are you crying, beautiful princess?"</p>
                <p>Looking around, she saw a frog sitting at the edge of the pond. The princess explained her plight, and the frog said, "I can retrieve your ball, but you must promise to be my friend and let me live with you in the palace."</p>
                <p>Desperate to get her ball back, the princess agreed to the frog's terms, thinking he was just a silly frog and she wouldn’t have to keep her promise. The frog dived into the pond and quickly returned with the golden ball. The princess snatched it from him and ran back to the palace, forgetting all about her promise.</p>
                <p>That evening, while the royal family was having dinner, there was a knock at the door. To the princess’s surprise, it was the frog. He reminded her of her promise, and reluctantly, she let him in. The frog sat at the table, ate from her plate, and even slept on a pillow beside her bed.</p>
                <p>The next morning, the frog asked for a kiss. Although she was hesitant, the princess kissed the frog. To her astonishment, the frog transformed into a handsome prince. He explained that he had been cursed by a wicked witch and only a kiss from a princess could break the spell.</p>
                <p>The prince and the princess soon fell in love and were married in a grand ceremony. They lived happily ever after, and the princess learned the importance of keeping her promises and looking beyond appearances.</p>
