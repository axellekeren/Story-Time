            <h2>The Lost Kitten</h2>
            <article>
                <p>One sunny afternoon, Sarah found a tiny kitten hiding under a bush near her house. Its fur was a soft gray, and it mewed pitifully, looking scared and alone. Sarah gently picked up the kitten and stroked its fur, soothing it with gentle whispers.</p>
                <p>She took the kitten inside, gave it a bowl of milk, and made a cozy bed for it in a corner of her room. The kitten, feeling safe and warm, soon fell asleep. Sarah named her new friend Whiskers.</p>
                <p>Days passed, and Sarah and Whiskers became inseparable. They played together in the garden, and Whiskers would curl up in Sarah's lap as she read her favorite books. Sarah's parents, seeing how happy Whiskers made their daughter, agreed to let her keep the kitten.</p>
                <p>One evening, Sarah noticed a poster in the neighborhood about a missing gray kitten. She realized that Whiskers must belong to someone who was missing her dearly. With a heavy heart, Sarah decided to find Whiskers' owner.</p>
                <p>The next day, Sarah and Whiskers walked around the neighborhood, asking people if they had lost a kitten. Finally, they met a tearful little girl who exclaimed, "That's my Whiskers!"</p>
                <p>Sarah knew she had to return Whiskers to her rightful owner, even though it meant saying goodbye to her beloved friend. The little girl hugged Whiskers tightly and thanked Sarah for taking care of her kitten.</p>
                <p>As Sarah watched them walk away, she felt a mixture of sadness and happiness. She knew she had done the right thing, even though it was difficult. Whiskers' owner promised to visit often, and Sarah knew she had made a new friend in the little girl.</p>
                <p>And so, Sarah learned the joy of giving and the bittersweet feeling of letting go. Whiskers brought happiness not just to Sarah but also to another family who loved her dearly.</p>
