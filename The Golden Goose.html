            <h2>The Golden Goose</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a man who had three sons. The youngest son, called Simpleton, was often mocked and not taken seriously by his family. One day, the eldest son decided to go into the forest to cut wood, and his mother gave him a fine cake and a bottle of wine to take with him.</p>
                <p>As the eldest son was about to start his work, he met a little gray-haired old man who wished him good day and asked for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. The eldest son, however, was stingy and said, “If I give you my cake and wine, I won’t have enough for myself. Go away.” The old man walked away, and soon after, the eldest son cut himself badly and had to return home.</p>
                <p>The second son then went into the forest with the same provisions and met the same old man. He also refused to share his cake and wine, and soon met the same fate as his elder brother, cutting himself and having to go back home.</p>
                <p>Finally, Simpleton went into the forest with a simple cake made with water and some sour beer. When he met the old man, Simpleton kindly offered to share his humble meal. The old man was grateful and gave Simpleton a special gift in return – he told him that just beyond a certain tree, he would find a golden goose.</p>
                <p>Simpleton found the golden goose and took it with him. As he walked through the village, people who tried to steal the goose got stuck to it. One by one, more people tried to grab the goose or the ones already stuck, and they all ended up stuck together in a long line.</p>
                <p>Simpleton led this comical procession to a kingdom where the king’s daughter, who had never laughed, saw the strange sight and burst into laughter. The king, pleased to see his daughter laugh, promised her hand in marriage to Simpleton.</p>
                <p>Despite the king's reluctance to let his daughter marry a simpleton, he had given his word and allowed the marriage. Simpleton, with the help of the golden goose and his kind heart, proved himself to be worthy and wise. He and the princess lived happily ever after.</p>
